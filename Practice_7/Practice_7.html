<div class="name"><h2>Yacht A (142.8 metres)</h2></div>
<p>No super sailing yacht list would be complete without the mention of the ever-controversial and highly innovative 142.8-metre Sailing Yacht A. 
    Officially classified as a sail-assisted motor yacht, Sailing Yacht A blends elements of both sailing and motor yacht designs, 
    but due to those imposing 100-metre-high carbon fibres masts, makes the cut for our ‘largest sailing yachts in the world’ list. 
    Built by Nobiskrug and delivered in 2017, Sailing Yacht A is the longest yacht on the list.</p>

<div class="name"><h2>Black Pearl (106.7 metres)</h2></div>
<p>Designed and built to cross oceans under sail power alone, Black Pearl is widely considered as the official ‘largest sailing yacht in the world’ 
    at 106-metres in length. Delivered to her owner in 2018 and built by the Oceanco shipyard in the Netherlands, Black Pearl, 
    with her sophisticated energy-generation solar system and high-tech DynaRig setup by Dykstra Naval Architects, 
    is one of the most advanced yachts of her kind and was developed by her owner, together with a world-class design team.</p>

<div class="name"><h2> Maltese Falcon (88 metres)</h2></div>
<p>One of the most iconic yachts of all time and certainly one of the most photographed in recent years, the revolutionary 88-metre Maltese Falcon 
    is famed for her sophisticated automated square-rigged DynaRig sail plan. Three towering free-standing rotating carbon-fibre masts hold 25,800 
    square feet of canvas on 15 square sails delivering exceptional performance, speed and manoeuvrability. 
    The yacht, built by Perini Navi, and designed in collaboration with her first owner Tom Perkins, was sold in August of 2009 
    to her current owner, who actively takes part in superyacht regattas, showing off the yacht's capabilities.</p>
