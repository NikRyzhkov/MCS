<p>The vision of life. Enjoying life on the water simply should not remain a mere vision. A VISION 46 makes this a reality. 
    This yacht is made for people who want to stay on board for long periods of time without compromising any luxuries – at least, 
    not any which are technically possible on a yacht. 
    The VISION 46 has space for everything you like to have with you when sailing in both the two cabin and three cabin versions.</p>
<p><strong>Length of Hull 13,7m</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beam of Hull 4,19m</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cabins 2-3</strong></p>

<p>Diverse and functional. We believe that even smaller yachts can be tremendous fun. 
    With the CRUISER 34 we have succeeded in bringing together the most important aspects of sailing – sailing pleasure and spaciousness – 
    in one boat. This yacht has excellent – and very safe – sailing characteristics. 
    The XXL cockpit area is pleasantly commodious during sailing and in between. And below deck there is all the room you need for six people. 
    The CRUISER 34 is the small, yet still very great BAVARIA. It comes in a 2- and a 3-cabin version with single or twin helm positions.</p>
<p><strong>Length of Hull 9,75m</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beam of Hull 3,42m</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cabins 2-3</strong></p>

<div class="text"><p>Sandwich construction ensures longevity.</p>
    <p>Isophthalic acid (IPA) resins in the outer layers used during 
    the laminating process ensure that the hull of a BAVARIA is of the highest quality. These offer effective protection against osmosis 
    and thus promote longevity of the BAVARIA.</p> 
    <p>The hull and deck of a BAVARIA is formed by sandwich construction with foam inserts. 
    In sailing yachts the deck is reinforced with aluminium sheets where fittings are mounted. In the so‐called „marrying“ process shortly 
    before the end of production, the deck and hull are screwed and glued together.</p></div>
